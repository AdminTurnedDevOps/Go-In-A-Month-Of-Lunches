# Go-In-A-Month-Of-Lunches
Go In A Month Of Lunches is a Manning Publications book I am working on. Following the format of popular books such as Learn PowerShell In A Month Of Lunches and Learn Azure In A Month Of Lunches, this book follows the same format. It is dedicated to the reader that wants to study 1 hour to 1.5 hours per day on Go. Each chapter is 15-20 pages filled with hands-on demos.
